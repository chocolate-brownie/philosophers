# using gdb how do I identify where exactly I get segfault

To identify where a segfault occurs using GDB, follow these steps:

## 1. Compile with Debug Symbols

First compile your program with debugging information:

```bash
gcc -g -o my_program my_program.c
```


## 2. Start GDB with Your Program

```bash
gdb ./my_program
```


## 3. Run the Program in GDB

```gdb
(gdb) run
```

The program will execute until it crashes. GDB will show:

```
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
[Address] in [Function Name] ()
```


## 4. Get the Stack Trace

Use `backtrace` (or `bt`) to see the call stack:

```gdb
(gdb) backtrace
```

This shows the sequence of function calls leading to the crash. Look for the first frame containing **your code** (not system libraries).

## 5. Inspect the Faulting Line

If GDB shows source context, use `list` to display surrounding code:

```gdb
(gdb) list
```

For numeric addresses, use:

```gdb
(gdb) info line *[address]
```


## 6. Examine Variables

Check suspect variables/pointers:

```gdb
(gdb) print variable_name
(gdb) info locals
```


## Alternative Approach: Core Dumps

1. Enable core dumps:
```bash
ulimit -c unlimited
```

2. Run the program until it crashes (creates `core` file)
3. Analyze post-mortem:
```bash
gdb ./my_program core
```


## Pro Tips

- Use AddressSanitizer for detailed reports:

```bash
gcc -g -fsanitize=address -o my_program my_program.c
```

- For array/pointer errors, set watchpoints:

```gdb
(gdb) watch variable_name
```

Example debug session output:

```
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
0x0000555555555169 in main () at test.c:8
8         *null_ptr = 42;
(gdb) bt
#0  0x0000555555555169 in main () at test.c:8
```

Common causes revealed by GDB:

- Null pointer dereference (e.g., `*ptr` where `ptr == NULL`)
- Stack overflow (deep recursion)
- Invalid memory access (array out-of-bounds)

If GDB crashes during analysis (common with optimized binaries), recompile with `-O0` to disable optimizations[^8]. For persistent issues, check memory hardware using tools like `memtest86+`[^2].
